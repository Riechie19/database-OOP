# Database Project

This project involves designing a database system for a real estate company acting as a broker for property rentals and sales. The database design includes identifying entities and attributes, creating an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD), and mapping the ERD into a Relational Database Schema.

Key business rules considered in the design include:
- The company operates multiple branches, each managed by a branch leader and staffed by personnel across sales, administration, and relations divisions.
- Properties managed by the company vary in type, such as houses, warehouses, buildings, and commercial spaces, with each property linked to a specific branch.
- Property owners supply rental price information, and the company's relations division handles owner communication.
- Potential tenants, either individuals or institutions, can contact the company to express interest in properties and state their intended usage.
- Sales personnel manage tenant inquiries and facilitate transactions, registered as work orders.

Once a tenant agrees to rent, the administrative division handles contracts, payments, and property handovers, which may involve preparatory work like cleaning or repairs. Revenue from these transactions is recorded as company income.

The project's findings, including detailed business rule explanations and database design, are compiled in a [project paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3d9xWijLtemRD0sKnxJeFSgfw42QVid/view?usp=sharing) (in Bahasa Indonesia).

# Object-Oriented Programming Project
For the Object-Oriented Programming project, our team designed classes that represent the application domain, which is the same as the database project: a real estate agency acting as a broker for property rentals and sales. The class design process begins by identifying the necessary classes, along with their attributes and behaviors, to meet the company's operational needs. This is followed by creating a UML Class Diagram to define the relationships between the classes. Finally, the design is implemented using Python programming. The results are thoroughly documented in a [project paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bpmAhwiRN5Xlpfy15Im4bfNag31JEqFG/view?usp=sharing) (in Bahasa Indonesia).
